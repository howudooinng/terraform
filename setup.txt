THIS IS A COMPLETE GUIDE TO SETUP TERRAFORM ON YOUR LOCAL AS WELL AS ON AN EC2 Instance with AWS
Create a Server where we will install terraform.

terra-server -- server for terraform 

connect it to the terminal using ssh -- aws instance.

Install Terraform:
choose your OS and install accordingly

On AWS instance I have ubuntu linux so install terraform on linux commands I will use:


updating instance:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common

Install HashiCorp's GPG key.

$ wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

Verify the GPG key's fingerprint.

$ gpg --no-default-keyring \
--keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
--fingerprint

Add the official HashiCorp repository to your system.

$ echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

Update apt to download the package information from the HashiCorp repository.

$ sudo apt update

Install Terraform from the new repository.

$ sudo apt-get install terraform

Whole process of installing terraform on ec2 linux instance.

Similarly if you want to install terraform on your local,
choose the corresponding os and follow the install process as mentioned 
on Terraform official website.

So when you use VS code editor to code the Iac tool terraform with aws, it connects 
with your terraform present on your local machine which you have already installed 
using terraform official website documentation.

use command - "which terraform" to confirm the version on the vscode terminal as well as the local terminal
it will match and thus it confirms that both are same.

Terraform has a local provider by default.

Workflow of Terraform : {

    terraform init     - creates an environment 
    terraform validate - check the configuration
    terraform plan     - it shows the dry run for the script which needs to be run.
    terraform apply    - applies the changes and then it creates the infra 
    arguments vs attributes
    terraform destroy  - destroys the infrastructure 

    We can use -auto-approve suffix after the terraform apply/destroy
}


You can see providers on terraform website.

We need to get the provider of a cloud service provider for which we are creating 
the infrastructure for it.

To install a provider, we have to make a provider.tf file.

Terraform block does not have Parameters, only arguments.

Then do terraform init to intialise the provider for aws

Similarly for all the cloud provider, we can intall the respective provider from the website 


I have the provider now, we need awscli to connect to that account.

This the awscli install command:

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

aws cli configure

Access Key Id : then we have to go to the IAM,
create user - terra-admin -- give permissions - select the permissions and give it.
Create access key -- choose use case - cli here in this case.
Put the same access key id and secret access key

To configure the Provider, this will create your infra in this region.

The use 
Provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-2"
}
